Welcome to Autofac's documentation!
===================================

Autofac is an addictive `IoC container <http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html>`_ for Microsoft .NET 4.5, Silverlight 5, Windows Store apps, and Windows Phone 8 apps. It manages the dependencies between classes so that **applications stay easy to change as they grow** in size and complexity. This is achieved by treating regular .NET classes as :doc:`components <glossary>`.
