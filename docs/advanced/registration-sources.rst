====================
Registration Sources
====================

Many of the Autofac features are plugged into the container via ``IRegistrationSource``.

Information on implementing a registration source can be found `here <http://nblumhardt.com/2010/01/declarative-context-adapters-autofac2/>`_. A full example is also `on this StackOverflow question <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31885320/how-can-i-register-a-boundless-type-hierarchy-using-autofac/31897754>`_. This page will eventually be expanded to include this information directly.
