Community Support
=================

Autofac has a large community that can help you out if you have questions. If you can't find your answer in the documentation, you can...

- `Ask your question on StackOverflow <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/autofac>`_. Be sure to use the ``autofac`` tag in your question.
- `Start a discussion on the forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#forum/autofac>`_. This is a good idea if you have multiple questions or a question that might have a more subjective answer (e.g., "recommendations" sorts of things).

Commercial Support
==================

Several companies offer commercial support for Autofac questions/design issues:

- `Readify <http://readify.net>`_ - training and consulting services
- `CICLO <http://ciclo.pt/>`_ - commercial support and training
- `Continuous IT <http://continuousit.com>`_ - training, troubleshooting and implementation help

Note: while the above listed companies offer help, they are not officially affiliated with the Autofac project.

*If you would like your company listed here, please send an email to the discussion group.*
